For this project users will need...

1) The latest version of Python (2.7.3)
    http://python.org/download/
2) A music notation editor
    Musescore: http://musescore.org/en/download
3) MIT's music21
    http://code.google.com/p/music21/downloads/list

To run the code, navigate to the code directory and excecute...

python improv.py

The code will ask you to provide a corpus directory and a chord file. If you
leave both of these inputs blank it will use the corpus and chord file we have
provided by default.

Feel free to create your own chord files. You can do this
by creating a .txt file with three columns. One for the chord root, one for the
chord class (7,maj,min,fd,hd,aug7) and one for the chord duration.

Example:

C 7 2.0
G 7 2.0
F- maj 1.0
C 7 1.0
G# min 0.5
F maj 0.5

After the program processes the corpus, and generates the solo it will show
the final piece in the music editor installed on the user's computer.

Enjoy!
